# Introduction

## Background and Significance

-   Introduction to chitinases

    -   Define chitinases and their role in nature

    -   Discuss their importance in various biological processes, particularly in marine ecosystems

    -   Highlight their biotechnological applications (e.g. biofuel production, agriculture and waste management)

-   Deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments

    -   Provide an overview of deep-sea hydrothermal vents, particularly the unique conditions that make them interesting for enzyme discovery

    -   Explain the significance of studying microorganisms in these extreme environments, emphasizing their potential for novel biochemical pathways and enzymes

## Traditional Methods for Enzyme Discovery

-   Sequence-based screening

    -   Describe the conventional approach of enzyme discovery through sequence-based methods

    -   Discuss the limitations of relying solely on sequence homology, such as the risk of missing novel enzymes that do not have close sequence relatives

## Structure-Based Discovery

-   Introduction to structure-based screening

    -   Explain the concept of structure-based enzyme discovery

    -   Emphasize the advantages of structure-based methods, such as the conservation of structural folds over evolutionary time and the ability to identify novel enzymes without relying on sequence databases

-   AI-assisted structure modelling

    -   Introduce the role of AI in structure prediction and screening, focusing on tools like AlphaFold2

    -   Discuss the impact of these AI tools on accelerating and enhancing enzyme discovery
