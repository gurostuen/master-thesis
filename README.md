Start by editing the \_quarto.yml file. Here you need to edit the

-   title (line 5)
-   author (line 6)
-   chapters (line 9) if you add or remove any chapters
-   appendices (line 19) if you add or remove any appendices
-   echo to false to hide code
-   cover figure (line 42)
-   Degree etc (line 50)
-   Description of cover figure (line 64)

Each chapter should be a new file.

index.qmd is a special chapter that makes the cover page for the html version of the thesis and is hidden in the pdf version.

R code is run in each chapter independently. This probably isn't a big problem as most of the code will be for the results chapter. If you find you need to duplicate code across multiple chapters, consider using the [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) package.
