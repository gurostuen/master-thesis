The main aim of this master project is to use the strength of Artificial Intelligence-assisted (AI) structure-based screening, to discover novel chitinases. The advantage of going beyond the traditional sequence-based screening is multifaceted: (1) we avoid using sequence homology to known enzymes, i.e removing the need for functional databases, (2) employing screening on the structure level, knowing that a structural fold is more conserved through time of evolution than the primary amino acid sequence, and (3) using the powerful advantage of structure modelling by state-of-the-art AI-tools like AlphaFold2. Overall, there is a potential for discovery of novel enzymes, in this case chitinases, to be used in a biotechnological setting.

The sample to be used in this project is a metagenome derived from an in situ incubator (top chamber) deployed and recovered from an Arctic deep-sea hyrothermal vent field, the Jan Mayen Vent Field (Bruse vent site), after 1 year of incubation using chitin as a substrate. Incubation was performed as described in Stokke et al. 2020 (figure 1). Recently, three chitinases (discovered by sequence-based screening) have been successfully produced and characterised in the lab prior to the start pf the master project. These chitinases will serve as control experiments for chitinase activity in the project.
